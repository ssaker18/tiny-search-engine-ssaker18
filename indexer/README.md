#README file for Sebastian Saker's indexer module, cs50

Please note that my crawler has bugs and as such I will be using the 
crawler's output provided in ~cs50/data/tsa-output directory!
As such I manually inserted .crawler file into the pagedir given to me
in order to "test" if the directory was created by the crawler program. 

How to compile indexer.c and indexertest.c : make

How to test indexertest with valgrind: make memtest
(REMEMBER TO UPDATE THIS ONCE I HAVE FINISHED THE MAKEFILE FOR INDEXER!!)
