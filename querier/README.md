#README file for Sebastian Saker's querier module, cs50

Please note that my crawler has bugs and as such I will be using the 
crawler's output provided in ~cs50/data/tsa-output directory!
My indexer also had bugs and so I will be using the indexer output provided
to us.
As such I manually inserted .crawler file into the pagedir given to me
in order to "test" if the directory was created by the crawler program. 

How to compile querier.c : make

How to test querier: make test
